# homework-1
This is my homework for week 1

First I saved the starter code <cite>[https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram]</cite>

User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Next, I refactored the semantic HTML elements.

Next, I created a more descriptive title element and gave all of the images alt tags with descriptions.

Next, I refactored the css and fixed the element tags in the css and html files.
